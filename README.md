# STM32 LQFP64 BREAKOUT BOARD

This is a 64pin STM32 BREAKOUT BOARD inspired by "blue pill" STM32 48pin board (Maple mini clone).
Same features are Improved:

* 3.3v Power supply is better filtered as the VDDA.
* USB is ESD protected.
* added a USB reset circuit (not needed for some MCUs).
* Many Cortex M0, M3, M4 STM32 Microcontrolles may be mounted in this PCB layout.
Check notes in schematic and read STM32 datasheets. 
* Eagle PCB, Schematics.

* RTC oscillator is not implemented because no enought PCB spaces to follow STM design guide. ...I'll be pleased if anyone will find a solution
